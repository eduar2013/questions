Consider the following code:

class Account{
	private String id; private double balance;
	ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
	
	public void withdraw(double amt){
		try{
			lock.lock();
			if(balance > amt) balance = balance - amt;
		}finally{
			lock.unlock();
		}
	}
}

What can be done to make the above code thread safe?

*C.| Declare lock variable as private and final
D.| Make the lock variable private, final, and static
